Classes \u00a4 TorrentFile construct .torrent file. TorrentFileV2 construct .torrent v2 files using provided data. MetaFile base class for all MetaFile classes. Constants \u00a4 BLOCK_SIZE : int size of leaf hashes for merkle tree. HASH_SIZE : int Length of a sha256 hash. Bittorrent V2 \u00a4 From Bittorrent.org Documentation pages. Implementation details for Bittorrent Protocol v2. Note All strings in a .torrent file that contain text must be UTF-8 encoded. Meta Version 2 Dictionary: \u00a4 \"announce\": The URL of the tracker. \"info\": This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. \"name\": A display name for the torrent. It is purely advisory. \"piece length\": The number of bytes that each logical piece in the peer protocol refers to. I.e. it sets the granularity of piece, request, bitfield and have messages. It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key. Bittorrent V1 \u00a4 v1 meta-dictionary \u00a4 announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as. It is purely advisory. piece length : maps to the number of bytes in each piece the file is split into. For the purposes of transfer, files are split into fixed-size pieces which are all the same length except for possibly the last one which may be truncated. piece length : is almost always a power of two, most commonly 2^18 = 256 K pieces : maps to a string whose length is a multiple of 20. It is to be subdivided into strings of length 20, each of which is the SHA1 hash of the piece at the corresponding index. length : In the single file case, maps to the length of the file in bytes. files : If present then the download represents a single file, otherwise it represents a set of files which go in a directory structure. For the purposes of the other keys, the multi-file case is treated as only having a single file by concatenating the files in the order they appear in the files list. The files list is the value files maps to, and is a list of dictionaries containing the following keys: path : A list of UTF-8 encoded strings corresponding to subdirectory names, the last of which is the actual file name length : Maps to the length of the file in bytes. length : Only present if the content is a single file. Maps to the length of the file in bytes. Note In the single file case, the name key is the name of a file, in the muliple file case, it's the name of a directory.

It is purely advisory. \"piece length\": The number of bytes that each logical piece in the peer protocol refers to. I.e. it sets the granularity of piece, request, bitfield and have messages. It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key.","title":"Meta Version 2 Dictionary:"},{"location":"api/#bittorrent-v1","text":"","title":"Bittorrent V1"},{"location":"api/#v1-meta-dictionary","text":"announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as.

Some of the tools available include creating torrent files, editing portions of a torrent file, checking the integrity or completeness of downloaded torrent contents, displaying details of a torrentfile, generating magnet URLs for torrentfiles, and individual or batch rebuilding of torrent contents into their original directory structure. Options \u00a4 -h displays all relevant command line options and subcommands. -V displays program and version. -v enables debug mode and outputs a large amount of information to the terminal. -i activates interactive mode for selecting subcommands and options. Sub-commands \u00a4 create \u00a4 alias: c , new torrentfile create [options] <path> torrentfile c [options] <path> The create subcommand is used for generating new torrent files. The only required argument is the path( <path> ) to the contents file or directory. -a -t --announce --tracker Adds the list of url's that follow to the list of trackers for the newly created torrent file. Example -t http://url1 https://url2 ... -w --web-seeds Adds the list of urls that follow to the list of web-seed addresses for the newly created torrent file. --comment Includes the comment that follows to the metadata saved in the newly created torrent file. Example: --comment \"Created for MyTrackerExample.com\" --source Creates a source field in the info dictionary with the string that follows as the value. Frequently used for cross-seeding on private trackers. Example: --source MyTrackerExample -p --private Indicates that the torrent will be used on a private tracker. Disables multi-tracker protocols and DHT. --piece-length Uses the number that follows as the piece-length size for the newly created torrent file. If option isn't used the program will pick the ideal size. Acceptable values include 14-29 which is interpreted as the number to raise 2 by (e.g. 14 is interpreted as 16384), or any perfect power of 2 greater than or equal to 16 KiB and less than 1 GiB. Example: --piece-length 14 or --piece-length 16384 . --meta-version Use the following number as the Bittorrent version the torrent will be used on. The default is 1. Options: 1 - Bittorrent v1, 2 - Bittorrent v2, 3 - Bittorrent v1 & v2 Examples: --meta-version 1 , --meta-version 2 , --meta-version 3 -o --out Specify the full path to the newly created torrent file. The default is to save it adjacent to the content. Example: if content is at /home/user/torrents/content the default would create /home/user/torrents/content.torrent --cwd --current Changes the default save location to the current working directory. Example: if content is at /home/user/torrents/content this option would create ./content.torrent --progress --prog Options (0, 1): No status bar will be shown if 0. Otherwise the default and 1 argument means progress bar is shown info \u00a4 alias: i torrentfile info <path> torrentfile i <path> Display detailed information about a torrentfile such as trackers, size of contents, Bittorrent version, any comments left, date the torrent file was created and more. There is only one positional perameter which is the path to the torrent file and there are no optional arguments. /path/to/*.torrent The relative or absolute path to the torrent file. edit \u00a4 Edit some of the different information detailed in a torrent file. The fields that are editable each have option flags detialed below. Each option identifies the field to edit inside the torrent file and what the new value should be. If an option is not used then its field will be ommited in the newly created torrent file.

Classes \u00a4 TorrentFile construct .torrent file. TorrentFileV2 construct .torrent v2 files using provided data. MetaFile base class for all MetaFile classes. Constants \u00a4 BLOCK_SIZE : int size of leaf hashes for merkle tree. HASH_SIZE : int Length of a sha256 hash. Bittorrent V2 \u00a4 From Bittorrent.org Documentation pages. Implementation details for Bittorrent Protocol v2. Note All strings in a .torrent file that contain text must be UTF-8 encoded. Meta Version 2 Dictionary: \u00a4 \"announce\": The URL of the tracker. \"info\": This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. \"name\": A display name for the torrent. It is purely advisory. \"piece length\": The number of bytes that each logical piece in the peer protocol refers to. I.e. it sets the granularity of piece, request, bitfield and have messages. It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key. Bittorrent V1 \u00a4 v1 meta-dictionary \u00a4 announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as. It is purely advisory. piece length : maps to the number of bytes in each piece the file is split into. For the purposes of transfer, files are split into fixed-size pieces which are all the same length except for possibly the last one which may be truncated. piece length : is almost always a power of two, most commonly 2^18 = 256 K pieces : maps to a string whose length is a multiple of 20. It is to be subdivided into strings of length 20, each of which is the SHA1 hash of the piece at the corresponding index. length : In the single file case, maps to the length of the file in bytes. files : If present then the download represents a single file, otherwise it represents a set of files which go in a directory structure. For the purposes of the other keys, the multi-file case is treated as only having a single file by concatenating the files in the order they appear in the files list. The files list is the value files maps to, and is a list of dictionaries containing the following keys: path : A list of UTF-8 encoded strings corresponding to subdirectory names, the last of which is the actual file name length : Maps to the length of the file in bytes. length : Only present if the content is a single file. Maps to the length of the file in bytes. Note In the single file case, the name key is the name of a file, in the muliple file case, it's the name of a directory.

It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key.","title":"Meta Version 2 Dictionary:"},{"location":"torrent/#torrentfile.torrent--bittorrent-v1","text":"","title":"Bittorrent V1"},{"location":"torrent/#torrentfile.torrent--v1-meta-dictionary","text":"announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as. It is purely advisory. piece length : maps to the number of bytes in each piece the file is split into. For the purposes of transfer, files are split into fixed-size pieces which are all the same length except for possibly the last one which may be truncated. piece length : is almost always a power of two, most commonly 2^18 = 256 K pieces : maps to a string whose length is a multiple of 20. It is to be subdivided into strings of length 20, each of which is the SHA1 hash of the piece at the corresponding index. length : In the single file case, maps to the length of the file in bytes. files : If present then the download represents a single file, otherwise it represents a set of files which go in a directory structure. For the purposes of the other keys, the multi-file case is treated as only having a single file by concatenating the files in the order they appear in the files list. The files list is the value files maps to, and is a list of dictionaries containing the following keys: path : A list of UTF-8 encoded strings corresponding to subdirectory names, the last of which is the actual file name length : Maps to the length of the file in bytes. length : Only present if the content is a single file.
