Classes TorrentFile construct .torrent file. TorrentFileV2 construct .torrent v2 files using provided data. MetaFile base class for all MetaFile classes. Constants BLOCK_SIZE : int size of leaf hashes for merkle tree. HASH_SIZE : int Length of a sha256 hash. Bittorrent V2 From Bittorrent.org Documentation pages. Implementation details for Bittorrent Protocol v2. Note All strings in a .torrent file that contain text must be UTF-8 encoded. Meta Version 2 Dictionary: \"announce\": The URL of the tracker. \"info\": This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. \"name\": A display name for the torrent. It is purely advisory. \"piece length\": The number of bytes that each logical piece in the peer protocol refers to. I.e. it sets the granularity of piece, request, bitfield and have messages. It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key. Bittorrent V1 v1 meta-dictionary announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as. It is purely advisory. piece length : maps to the number of bytes in each piece the file is split into. For the purposes of transfer, files are split into fixed-size pieces which are all the same length except for possibly the last one which may be truncated. piece length : is almost always a power of two, most commonly 2^18 = 256 K pieces : maps to a string whose length is a multiple of 20. It is to be subdivided into strings of length 20, each of which is the SHA1 hash of the piece at the corresponding index. length : In the single file case, maps to the length of the file in bytes. files : If present then the download represents a single file, otherwise it represents a set of files which go in a directory structure. For the purposes of the other keys, the multi-file case is treated as only having a single file by concatenating the files in the order they appear in the files list. The files list is the value files maps to, and is a list of dictionaries containing the following keys: path : A list of UTF-8 encoded strings corresponding to subdirectory names, the last of which is the actual file name length : Maps to the length of the file in bytes. length : Only present if the content is a single file. Maps to the length of the file in bytes. Note In the single file case, the name key is the name of a file, in the muliple file case, it's the name of a directory.

An \u201cApplication\u201d is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. A \u201cCombined Work\u201d is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \u201cLinked Version\u201d. The \u201cMinimal Corresponding Source\u201d for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. The \u201cCorresponding Application Code\u201d for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified Versions If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 4. Combined Works You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. d) Do one of the following: . 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. . 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0 , the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1 , you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined Libraries You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

Classes TorrentFile construct .torrent file. TorrentFileV2 construct .torrent v2 files using provided data. MetaFile base class for all MetaFile classes. Constants BLOCK_SIZE : int size of leaf hashes for merkle tree. HASH_SIZE : int Length of a sha256 hash. Bittorrent V2 From Bittorrent.org Documentation pages. Implementation details for Bittorrent Protocol v2. Note All strings in a .torrent file that contain text must be UTF-8 encoded. Meta Version 2 Dictionary: \"announce\": The URL of the tracker. \"info\": This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. \"name\": A display name for the torrent. It is purely advisory. \"piece length\": The number of bytes that each logical piece in the peer protocol refers to. I.e. it sets the granularity of piece, request, bitfield and have messages. It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key. Bittorrent V1 v1 meta-dictionary announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as. It is purely advisory. piece length : maps to the number of bytes in each piece the file is split into. For the purposes of transfer, files are split into fixed-size pieces which are all the same length except for possibly the last one which may be truncated. piece length : is almost always a power of two, most commonly 2^18 = 256 K pieces : maps to a string whose length is a multiple of 20. It is to be subdivided into strings of length 20, each of which is the SHA1 hash of the piece at the corresponding index. length : In the single file case, maps to the length of the file in bytes. files : If present then the download represents a single file, otherwise it represents a set of files which go in a directory structure. For the purposes of the other keys, the multi-file case is treated as only having a single file by concatenating the files in the order they appear in the files list. The files list is the value files maps to, and is a list of dictionaries containing the following keys: path : A list of UTF-8 encoded strings corresponding to subdirectory names, the last of which is the actual file name length : Maps to the length of the file in bytes. length : Only present if the content is a single file. Maps to the length of the file in bytes. Note In the single file case, the name key is the name of a file, in the muliple file case, it's the name of a directory.

Classes TorrentFile construct .torrent file. TorrentFileV2 construct .torrent v2 files using provided data. MetaFile base class for all MetaFile classes. Constants BLOCK_SIZE : int size of leaf hashes for merkle tree. HASH_SIZE : int Length of a sha256 hash. Bittorrent V2 From Bittorrent.org Documentation pages. Implementation details for Bittorrent Protocol v2. Note All strings in a .torrent file that contain text must be UTF-8 encoded. Meta Version 2 Dictionary: \"announce\": The URL of the tracker. \"info\": This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. \"name\": A display name for the torrent. It is purely advisory. \"piece length\": The number of bytes that each logical piece in the peer protocol refers to. I.e. it sets the granularity of piece, request, bitfield and have messages. It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key. Bittorrent V1 v1 meta-dictionary announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as. It is purely advisory. piece length : maps to the number of bytes in each piece the file is split into. For the purposes of transfer, files are split into fixed-size pieces which are all the same length except for possibly the last one which may be truncated. piece length : is almost always a power of two, most commonly 2^18 = 256 K pieces : maps to a string whose length is a multiple of 20. It is to be subdivided into strings of length 20, each of which is the SHA1 hash of the piece at the corresponding index. length : In the single file case, maps to the length of the file in bytes. files : If present then the download represents a single file, otherwise it represents a set of files which go in a directory structure. For the purposes of the other keys, the multi-file case is treated as only having a single file by concatenating the files in the order they appear in the files list. The files list is the value files maps to, and is a list of dictionaries containing the following keys: path : A list of UTF-8 encoded strings corresponding to subdirectory names, the last of which is the actual file name length : Maps to the length of the file in bytes. length : Only present if the content is a single file. Maps to the length of the file in bytes. Note In the single file case, the name key is the name of a file, in the muliple file case, it's the name of a directory.

It is purely advisory. \"piece length\": The number of bytes that each logical piece in the peer protocol refers to. I.e. it sets the granularity of piece, request, bitfield and have messages. It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key.","title":"Meta Version 2 Dictionary:"},{"location":"source/#torrentfile.torrent--bittorrent-v1","text":"","title":"Bittorrent V1"},{"location":"source/#torrentfile.torrent--v1-meta-dictionary","text":"announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as.

It is purely advisory. \"piece length\": The number of bytes that each logical piece in the peer protocol refers to. I.e. it sets the granularity of piece, request, bitfield and have messages. It must be a power of two and at least 6KiB. \"meta version\": An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this specification. Version 1 is not assigned to avoid confusion with BEP3. Future revisions will only increment this issue to indicate an incompatible change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lementations must check this field first and indicate that a torrent is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other idations which may result in more general messages about invalid files. Files are mapped into this piece address space so that each non-empty \"file tree\": A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements. Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point. 'UTF-8 encoded' context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation time it must be converted to UTF-8. Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on specific filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them. On platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized since they could lead to directory traversal attacks and conflicting path descriptions. On platforms that require UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings. File is aligned to a piece boundary and occurs in same order as the file tree. The last piece of each file may be shorter than the specified piece length, resulting in an alignment gap. \"length\": Length of the file in bytes. Presence of this field indicates that the dictionary describes a file, not a directory. Which means it must not have any sibling entries. \"pieces root\": For non-empty files this is the the root hash of a merkle tree with a branching factor of 2, constructed from 16KiB blocks of the file. The last block may be shorter than 16KiB. The remaining leaf hashes beyond the end of the file required to construct upper layers of the merkle tree are set to zero. As of meta version 2 SHA2-256 is used as digest function for the merkle tree. The hash is stored in its binary form, not as human-readable string. \"piece layers\": A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size it contains one string value. The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes of one layer within that merkle tree. The layer is chosen so that one hash covers piece length bytes. For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used. If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used. Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file, i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted. All hashes are stored in their binary format. A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer. Important The file tree root dictionary itself must not be a file, i.e. it must not contain a zero-length key with a dictionary containing a length key.","title":"Meta Version 2 Dictionary:"},{"location":"source/#torrentfile.torrent--bittorrent-v1","text":"","title":"Bittorrent V1"},{"location":"source/#torrentfile.torrent--v1-meta-dictionary","text":"announce: The URL of the tracker. info: This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below. name : maps to a UTF-8 encoded string which is the suggested name to save the file (or directory) as.
